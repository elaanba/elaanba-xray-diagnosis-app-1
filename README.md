# ðŸ©» Chest X-ray Tube & Catheter Positioning Error Detection

This Flask web app allows users to upload chest X-ray images and detect medical tube and catheter mispositioning using a pre-trained deep learning model in TensorFlow Lite format.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Upload a patient's chest X-ray image
- Select a model from a list of available `.tflite` models
- Perform inference using the selected model
- View a diagnosis table with classification probabilities
- Download diagnosis results as a CSV file

This app uses classification models that detect positioning errors for:

ETT: Endotracheal Tube

NGT: Nasogastric Tube

CVC: Central Venous Catheter

Each class includes "normal", "borderline", and "abnormal" positioning.
